
1. **HTML Setup:**
    - Create an HTML file (`index.html`) with the basic structure.
    - Add a form to take user input for four words.
    - Set the form action to the PHP script (`jumble.php`) that will handle the input.

2. **PHP Script Setup:**
    - Create a new PHP file (`jumble.php`) to handle form submission.
    - Define a function (`displayError`) to display error messages for a specified field.
    - Define a function (`validateWord`) to validate and jumble a word input by the user.

3. **Form Submission Handling:**
    - Retrieve the user-input words from the form using `$_POST`.
    - Call the `validateWord` function for each word to perform validation and jumbling.

4. **Validation and Jumbling Logic:**
    - Check if the word is empty. If yes, display an error message.
    - Use a regular expression to check if the word contains only letters.
    - Check if the word length is between 4 and 7 characters.
    - If all checks pass, convert the word to uppercase and shuffle the characters.

5. **Error Counting:**
    - Maintain a global variable (`$errorCount`) to count the number of errors encountered during validation.

6. **Display Results or Errors:**
    - If `$errorCount` is greater than 0, display an error message prompting the user to go back and re-enter data.
    - If there are no errors, display the jumbled words.

7. **HTML Output:**
    - Display the results or error messages within the HTML structure.

8. **Testing:**
    - Test the script with various inputs, including empty fields, non-letter characters, and words of different lengths.
    - Ensure that the error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.
    - Confirm that the jumbled words are displayed when there are no errors.

9. **Deployment:**
    - Place the HTML and PHP files in the appropriate directory on a web server.

10. **Accessing the Lab:**
    - Access the lab through a web browser by navigating to the appropriate URL.

11. **Observation:**
    - Observe the behavior of the script and analyze the output.

12. **Documentation:**
    - Document the steps taken, any issues encountered, and solutions implemented during the development and testing process.

By following this logical approach, you can systematically create, test, and deploy the Jumble Maker script, ensuring a well-organized and functional solution.
